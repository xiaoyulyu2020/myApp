# CA326 template repo

This is a template for CA326 projects.

## 1. Create your repo

One person from your project team should fork this repo, then add other teammates as project members on GitLab.

## 2. Name your repo appropriately

The name of your repo must be of the form `2023-ca326-XXXXXXX`, where "`XXXXXXX`"
should be replaced with your usernames (e.g. `2023-ca326-sblott-pclarke`).

**Note** that the year should be set as appropriate to your year of study. For example, in the
2023/2024 academic year this would change to `2024-ca326-sblott-pclarke`),
in the 2024/2025 academic year this would change to `2025-ca326-sblott-pclarke`), etc.

It is the *name of your repo* which matters (not the name of your project).

You can change the name of your repo on GitLab under:

- Settings / General / Advanced / Change path

It looks like this:

![change-repo-path](./res/repo-change-path.png "Change repo path.")

You should replace all of this file with a README describing your own project.
